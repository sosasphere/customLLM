Account Updater Services: Enhancing Payment Processing Efficiency

As businesses increasingly rely on recurring payments and subscriptions, maintaining accurate customer payment information has become essential for ensuring seamless transactions. Account Updater services address this need by automatically updating stored cardholder information, reducing failed transactions, and improving customer experience. By enabling businesses to manage card data changes without requiring customers to manually update their information, Account Updater services have revolutionized how merchants handle recurring billing and subscription models. This essay explores the workings, benefits, challenges, and future prospects of Account Updater services, illustrating their role in the modern payment ecosystem.
Introduction to Account Updater Services

Account Updater services are tools provided by credit card networks and payment processors to help businesses manage cardholder data automatically. These services automatically update stored credit and debit card information, such as new card numbers or expiration dates, in cases where customers’ card details have changed due to events like card expiration, replacement, or upgrades. This feature is especially beneficial for businesses with recurring billing models, as it reduces the frequency of failed payments due to outdated card information.

For merchants, particularly those offering subscription services, maintaining up-to-date card data is essential to ensure that payments go through successfully without needing to contact customers for updates. By using Account Updater services, businesses can minimize disruptions in service, retain customers, and optimize revenue collection.
How Account Updater Services Work

The functionality of Account Updater services involves multiple stages, typically executed through partnerships with card networks like Visa and Mastercard, which provide regular updates on changes to cardholder information. The process generally works as follows:

    Data Submission: Businesses or their payment processors send encrypted requests to the Account Updater service, typically on a recurring schedule or before a billing cycle.
    Matching and Update Retrieval: The Account Updater service cross-references the submitted information with card networks, checking for updates to the card details.
    Data Return and Synchronization: The service returns any updated information (new card numbers, expiration dates) to the merchant or payment processor, who then updates the stored data in their systems.
    Billing Continuity: With updated card data, the merchant can proceed with billing uninterrupted, preventing declines due to outdated information.

The frequency of updates may vary depending on the provider, with most offering monthly or even weekly updates to ensure businesses maintain accurate records. This proactive approach to managing customer card data has become a cornerstone for companies operating in the subscription economy, from streaming services to software providers.
Benefits of Account Updater Services

Account Updater services provide multiple advantages to both businesses and customers, creating a smoother and more reliable payment experience. Some key benefits include:

    Reduced Payment Declines: One of the most significant advantages of Account Updater services is the reduction in declined transactions. Outdated card information is a primary cause of declined payments, leading to service interruptions, customer churn, and administrative burden. By automatically updating card data, Account Updater services significantly reduce the risk of declines.

    Enhanced Customer Experience: When transactions are successful without requiring customers to re-enter information, the result is a frictionless payment experience. This is particularly important for subscription-based businesses, where a seamless experience contributes to higher customer satisfaction and retention.

    Improved Revenue Continuity: Failed payments due to outdated card information can lead to lost revenue, especially for businesses that depend on recurring payments. By reducing transaction failures, Account Updater services help businesses retain steady cash flow and improve overall revenue consistency.

    Operational Efficiency: Automating the process of updating card information reduces the workload on customer service teams, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks instead of handling declined transactions. This also minimizes the need for outreach to customers to request updated payment information.

Account Updater Providers and Services

Account Updater services are typically offered by major card networks and payment processors. Visa offers a service known as Visa Account Updater (VAU), while Mastercard provides Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater (ABU). Both services are available to merchants through their payment processors, who serve as intermediaries. Other payment processors like American Express and Discover also offer similar services, enabling businesses to access updates for all major card types.

For merchants, selecting a processor that offers Account Updater services through multiple card networks is essential for comprehensive coverage, especially for companies with a global customer base. Worldpay, for instance, provides integrated Account Updater services, giving businesses streamlined access to cardholder data updates across different networks.

    Compliance and Data Security: Handling customer card data comes with strict security requirements under regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). While Account Updater services are designed to be secure, businesses must ensure that they comply with all regulations and that their systems are capable of securely managing updated card data.

    Incomplete Coverage: Account Updater services rely on card networks, meaning that only those networks that support the service will offer data updates. If a merchant accepts payment methods outside of traditional credit and debit cards, such as bank transfers, these may not be supported by Account Updater services, limiting the service's coverage.

    Customer Consent and Transparency: In some regions, regulations require businesses to obtain explicit consent from customers before using Account Updater services. This requirement can add a layer of complexity, as businesses must ensure customers are fully informed and provide consent to automatic updates.

Account Updater Services in Different Industries

Account Updater services are particularly valuable for industries where recurring payments are the norm. Some of the most common industries using these services include:

    Subscription-Based Media and Streaming Services: Companies like Netflix and Spotify rely heavily on Account Updater services to maintain uninterrupted service, ensuring that subscribers don’t face disruption due to card changes.

    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): SaaS companies, which generally operate on monthly or yearly billing cycles, benefit from Account Updater services to ensure that subscription renewals go smoothly without requiring customers to update card information manually.

    E-Commerce and Retail: Many e-commerce companies offer subscription boxes or membership services, where Account Updater services help keep transactions seamless, reducing the chance of losing customers due to payment failures.

    Telecommunications: With customers often paying monthly bills, telecommunications companies use Account Updater services to keep payments on track, reducing the risk of missed payments and service disruptions.

Account Updater

Account Updater is an optional product that allows you to request and receive updated information concerning MasterCard, Visa, and Discover cardholder accounts.

 
This product is used most often by merchants who offer a recurring billing payment plan for their customers. This introductory material contains the following sections:

    Overview
    Requirements
    Best Practices



Note

Contact your Relationship/Corporate Support Manager with any questions related to this Value Added Service.
Overview
The primary users of the Account Updater service are merchants that engage in recurring billing scenarios. This type of billing includes subscription services, membership fees, multi-payment programs, and various preferred customer programs.

If you engage in this type of billing, it is inevitable that you receive some percentage of authorization failures each billing period due to changed account information. Normally, someone in your organization would then contact the cardholder to obtain updated information and re-submit the transaction. This ties-up your resources, causes additional expenses, and runs the risk of the cardholder ending the service.

Using Account Updater, you can submit a request (a minimum of five days in advance is recommended) for changed card information about the cardholders approaching their billing date. This same process applies if you are a tokenized merchant, except that you would typically supply the token instead of the card number. Each cardholder for which you receive updated information saves you money, time and (potentially) business.

Best Practice

Since you only pay for matches, you may wish to make requests for larger numbers of cardholders rather than only those approaching their billing date. Worldpay recommends that you cycle through your cardholder database at least twice per year.


Account Updater Features and Limitations
Account Updater enables you to receive updated credit card information without having to contact each customer individually. The feature provides updates for the following information:

    New account number and/or new expiration date (or new token if applicable)
    Information about accounts transitioning from Visa to MasterCard and vice versa due to bank portfolio migration scenario
    Account closed notification
    Contact customer notification

Account Updater is available for Visa, MasterCard, and Discover payment cards. Other payment types do not participate in this program. Also, Account Updater does not support change of address or AVS updates.

Note

If you are a tokenized merchant and submit credit card information, the system returns updated credit card information. The system does not register the card and return a token for Account Updater transactions. If you submit a token, the system returns a token.


Account Updater Work Flow
The illustration below shows the Account Updater work flow, which requires several days to complete. For example, if you submit an Account Updater request on Monday (day one), Worldpay accumulates data from the networks Tuesday through Friday (days two through four), and the completed response would be ready on Friday (day five). Worldpay processes Account Updater files seven days per week. account_updater_activity_flow_worldpay
The process is as follows:

    Day One - you submit a request containing the relevant customer account numbers and expiration dates to verify. Worldpay immediately returns a confirmation file that contains basic validation information as follows:
        Approved - indicates the data passed validation.
        Invalid credit card number - indicates that the card data failed a validation. You must correct the issue and resubmit.
        Invalid expiration date - indicates that the date failed validation. You must correct the issue and resubmit.

    Worldpay forwards all approved Account Updater transactions to the network.
    Days Two Through Four - Each day, the network provides available account data to Worldpay.
    Day Five - Worldpay creates a completion response file containing updated account information. You retrieve your response file by logging into your FTP account.

After retrieval, review the completion response file and use the data to update your customer data as necessary.

A Comprehensive Overview of Payments
Introduction to Payments

Payments are a foundational element of any economy, allowing individuals, businesses, and governments to exchange goods and services efficiently. From the earliest barter systems to digital transactions, payment systems have evolved tremendously. Today, payments encompass a wide range of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, electronic funds transfers, and mobile payments, each designed to meet different needs and technological advancements.
Historical Evolution of Payment Systems

    Barter and Commodity-Based Payments: In ancient times, people used barter systems, exchanging goods directly without a common currency. As societies developed, they began using commodity money (items with intrinsic value, such as gold or silver) as a medium of exchange.

    Fiat Currency: With the advent of centralized states, fiat money—currency without intrinsic value but accepted by decree—became the norm. Central banks issued this currency, and it became widely accepted because of the trust in the issuing authority.

    Checks and Wire Transfers: The need for secure, verifiable transactions led to the creation of checks and wire transfers. These systems reduced the need for physical cash, allowing funds to be exchanged through written authorizations and telegraphic communication.

    Electronic Payments and Credit Cards: The mid-20th century brought the introduction of credit cards and electronic payment systems, marking the start of the digital payment revolution. These innovations enabled individuals and businesses to transact more flexibly and efficiently.

    Digital and Mobile Payments: With the rise of the internet, digital and mobile payments have transformed commerce. E-commerce has allowed consumers to shop globally, and mobile payments have enabled instant peer-to-peer transfers and online purchases.

Types of Payment Systems

    Cash Payments: Traditional cash payments remain popular worldwide, especially in economies where digital infrastructure is less developed. Cash is convenient for small transactions and doesn’t rely on technology, but it lacks the security and traceability of digital methods.

    Checks: Checks allow individuals and businesses to pay by authorizing a bank to transfer a specified amount from one account to another. While still used for certain transactions, checks are less common due to the slower processing times and the risk of fraud.

    Credit and Debit Cards: Credit and debit cards are one of the most widely used payment methods. Credit cards enable users to borrow funds up to a certain limit for purchases, while debit cards directly withdraw from the user’s bank account. Both offer convenience, fraud protection, and rewards, and they are accepted globally.

    Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs): EFTs allow for the direct transfer of funds from one bank account to another. They include automated clearing house (ACH) payments, wire transfers, and other digital transfers, and are often used for payroll, bills, and larger business transactions.

    Digital Wallets and Mobile Payments: Digital wallets (such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and PayPal) securely store payment information on mobile devices, allowing users to pay in-store or online with a few taps. These wallets use encryption and tokenization to protect sensitive information, making them popular for their convenience and security.

    Cryptocurrency Payments: Cryptocurrency payments, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, represent a new decentralized form of digital currency. While still niche, cryptocurrencies offer a secure and transparent way to transfer funds without the need for a centralized intermediary. They are particularly popular in regions with unstable currencies and are increasingly accepted by online retailers and service providers.

    Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL): BNPL is a relatively new payment method where consumers can make purchases and pay for them in installments over time, often with no interest. This option is popular among younger consumers and has been integrated into e-commerce platforms as a flexible alternative to traditional credit.

Technologies Enabling Modern Payment Systems

    Point of Sale (POS) Systems: POS systems allow businesses to process transactions in-store, linking payment methods (such as cards or digital wallets) with the merchant's account. Modern POS systems can also track inventory, analyze sales data, and integrate with online platforms, creating an omnichannel experience for retailers.

    Payment Gateways and Processors: A payment gateway is a technology that captures and transfers payment data from the customer to the acquiring bank, while a payment processor handles the transaction’s actual processing, ensuring funds are securely transferred. Payment gateways and processors provide an interface between merchants, customers, and financial institutions.

    Encryption and Tokenization: Security is paramount in payments, and encryption and tokenization are two critical technologies that protect data during transactions. Encryption secures data by converting it into code, while tokenization replaces sensitive information (like a card number) with a unique identifier (token) to reduce fraud risks.

    Biometric Authentication: With mobile devices and biometric data, payment systems have incorporated authentication methods such as fingerprint scans, facial recognition, and voice authentication. These methods enhance security and reduce the likelihood of fraud by verifying users’ identities.

    Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology: Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, provides a decentralized ledger that records transactions transparently and securely. Blockchain’s use in payments is still growing, but it has the potential to increase the speed, security, and transparency of international payments.

    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: AI and machine learning help identify and mitigate fraud by analyzing transaction patterns and flagging anomalies. AI-driven models in payment systems can detect suspicious activities in real-time, improving security and efficiency.

Emerging Trends in Payment Systems

    Contactless Payments: The adoption of contactless payments has surged, driven by the demand for faster, more hygienic transactions. These payments use near-field communication (NFC) technology, allowing users to tap their card or device on a POS terminal for instant processing.

    Globalization and Cross-Border Payments: As businesses expand internationally, there is a growing need for efficient cross-border payment systems. Cross-border payments have traditionally been slow and costly due to currency exchanges and intermediary banks, but innovations like blockchain aim to streamline these processes.

    Instant and Real-Time Payments: Real-time payment systems, such as the U.S. FedNow, Europe’s SEPA Instant Credit Transfer, and India’s UPI, enable immediate transfers 24/7. Real-time payments increase convenience and improve cash flow for individuals and businesses alike.

    Open Banking: Open banking regulations, particularly in Europe and the UK, require banks to open their data to third-party providers. This enables new financial services, including integrated payment platforms, allowing consumers to manage accounts across multiple banks from a single application.

    Embedded Finance: Embedded finance refers to integrating financial services (like payments, lending, and insurance) directly into non-financial platforms. For example, ride-sharing apps and e-commerce websites now offer in-app payments, creating a seamless customer experience.

    Voice-Activated Payments: Voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant are starting to offer payment functionalities. Voice payments are especially useful for hands-free convenience and are likely to become more common as voice recognition technology improves.

    Regulations and Compliance: As payment systems evolve, regulations are critical to ensuring consumer protection, security, and financial stability. Standards like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and regulations such as the EU’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) impose requirements on companies to protect user data and maintain secure systems.
